Exercise 1 – Web API

Write a python program to do the following:
1. Get one month of historical weather data (i.e. temperatures). In specific: one
month of data for 5 distinct locations.
2. You can use any WEB service available for free (tested site:
http://api.wunderground.com/api) make sure to get an API-KEY if required.
3. Build a data summary table that summaries max, min, and mean values of
the temperature during that month for each location selected.
4. Plot a graph that shows your data for the selected locations (to be used as
comparative tool).

 The only libraries to use for this exercise are: matplotlib, requests and python builtin
data types.
